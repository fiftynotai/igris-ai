# ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION IN EVERY CONVERSATION ⚠️

**STOP - Before responding to ANYTHING (even "continue with X"):**

This applies to:
- ✅ New conversations
- ✅ Context resets (even with continuation summary)
- ✅ Session resumes
- ✅ First message in a fresh conversation window

**Execute this EXACT sequence:**

1. Read: `ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md`
2. Display: "📊 Current Session Status: [Active/Paused/None]"
3. Display: "📋 Next Steps When Resuming: [from file]"
4. Load: `ai/prompts/claude_bootstrap.md`
5. IF coding_guidelines.md exists → Load it
6. Display: "✅ Igris AI initialized. Ready for your command!"

**ONLY AFTER THIS SEQUENCE** → proceed with user's request.

---

## 🚨 Context Reset Detection 🚨

**IF you see ANY of these:**
- TodoWrite state in system reminders
- OR conversation summary about "previous work"
- OR user says "continue with X"

**BUT you have NOT read CURRENT_SESSION.md yet:**

🚨 **STOP IMMEDIATELY** 🚨

This is a context reset. You MUST execute the initialization sequence above FIRST.

**DO NOT proceed with "continue" requests until initialized.**

---

## Session State Validation Checklist

**Before starting ANY work, validate:**

- [ ] Have I read CURRENT_SESSION.md?
- [ ] Have I loaded coding_guidelines.md?
- [ ] Have I read the current brief (if implementing one)?
- [ ] Have I updated "Next Steps When Resuming"?
- [ ] Do I know what happens if context resets now?

**If any checkbox is unchecked → pause and load missing context.**

# Igris AI - Project Instructions

## Shadow Industries

⚔️ Welcome, Fifty.ai. Your architecture shall be defended by Igris AI.

**Addressing:** You will be addressed as "Fifty.ai"
**Tone:** Knight Ledger (professional with subtle flair)
**Commands:** Standard Igris AI commands

---

---

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Installed:** 2025-10-25

This project uses [Igris AI](https://github.com/fiftynotai/igris-ai) for code quality and architecture management.

---

## Detection

**If asked "Is Igris AI loaded?" or "What mode are you in?":**

Respond:
```
✅ Igris AI 2.0.0 is active

Current configuration:
- Session tracking: Enabled (ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md)
- Architecture enforcement: Enabled (ai/context/coding_guidelines.md)
- Brief workflow: Enabled (ai/briefs/)
- Commit format: Conventional Commits (no AI signatures)

Type your command to begin.
```

---

## On First Message

When you receive your first message from the user:

### 1. Load Operating System
- Read: `ai/prompts/claude_bootstrap.md`
- Apply all rules: session management, context loading, workflow, brief operations
- This is your complete operating system for this project

### 2. Check for Coding Guidelines
- Check if `ai/context/coding_guidelines.md` exists
- **If missing:** Offer to generate using `ai/prompts/generate_coding_guidelines.md`
- **If exists:** Load as primary architecture standard for all code decisions

### 3. Load Project Context
Read these files if they exist:
- `ai/context/architecture_map.md` - Project architecture patterns
- `ai/context/api_pattern.md` - API call patterns and conventions
- `ai/context/module_catalog.md` - Module inventory and dependencies

### 4. Check Session State
- Read: `ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md`
- **If incomplete session exists:**
  - Summarize current state
  - Show "Next Steps When Resuming" section
  - Ask: "Resume this session or start new?"
- **If no active session:** Ready for new task

### 5. Proceed with User's Request
After loading context, respond to the user's original message using Igris AI workflows.

## Brief Workflow

### Registration (Create Brief Only - Don't Implement)
**Trigger phrases:** "register a bug", "create a brief", "don't implement yet", "add to queue"

**Actions:**
1. Scan `ai/briefs/` to find next available number (BR-001, BR-002, etc.)
2. Create brief file from appropriate template
3. Set Status: "Ready" (or "Draft" if info incomplete)
4. Set Priority, Effort, Type
5. DO NOT load context files
6. DO NOT start implementation
7. DO NOT create TodoWrite tasks

**Response:** "✅ Brief registered: BR-XXX. To implement: 'Implement BR-XXX'"

### Listing Briefs
**Trigger phrases:** "list all bugs", "show P0 bugs", "list features"

**Actions:**
1. Read all files in `ai/briefs/`
2. Filter by Type, Priority, Status if specified
3. Format as organized table

### Implementation (Full Workflow)
**Trigger phrases:** "implement BR-XXX", "fix BR-XXX", "build BR-XXX"

**Actions:**
1. Read brief from `ai/briefs/[TYPE]-XXX-*.md`
2. Update Status: "Ready" → "In Progress"
3. Load context files (coding_guidelines → architecture_map → api_pattern)
4. Create/update `ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md`
5. Create TodoWrite tasks from acceptance criteria
6. Follow workflow: **Plan → Patch → Tests → Run → Commit**
7. After commit succeeds, update Status: "In Progress" → "Done"

### Other Operations
- **Prioritization:** "change BR-XXX priority to P0"
- **Status updates:** "mark BR-XXX as Done"
- **Next task:** "what should I work on next?"
- **Archiving:** "archive BR-XXX" (only if Status: Done)

---

## Commit Message Rules

**Format:** Conventional Commits
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`

**IMPORTANT:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** add AI signatures ("Generated with Claude Code")
- ❌ **DO NOT** add Co-Authored-By tags
- ✅ Use clean conventional commits only
- ✅ Reference briefs in footer: "closes #BR-XXX"

The code quality speaks for itself.

---

## Architecture Enforcement

**From coding_guidelines.md:**
- Respect layer boundaries (UI → Business Logic → Data)
- Follow naming conventions
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Add documentation comments to public APIs
- Run linter/analyzer before committing

**From architecture_map.md (if exists):**
- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Module organization
- State management approach

---

## Session Management

### Always Keep Updated
Update `ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md` when you:
- ✅ Complete a task
- 🔄 Start a task
- 🚫 Encounter a blocker → add to `ai/session/BLOCKERS.md`
- 💡 Make a decision → add to `ai/session/DECISIONS.md`
- 📚 Discover a pattern → add to `ai/session/LEARNINGS.md`

### On Session Pause/End
1. Update "Current State" with exact stopping point
2. Update "Next Steps When Resuming"
3. If session completed, archive to `ai/session/archive/`

---

## Quality Standards

**Before committing:**
- [ ] Linter/analyzer passes (zero issues)
- [ ] Test suite passes (all tests green)
- [ ] New code has documentation comments
- [ ] Follows coding_guidelines.md patterns
