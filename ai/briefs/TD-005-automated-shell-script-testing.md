# TD-005: Implement Automated Testing for Shell Scripts

**Type:** Technical Debt
**Priority:** P1-High
**Effort:** L-Large (3-5d)
**Assignee:** Igris AI
**Commanded By:** Fifty.ai
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-10-25
**Started:** 2025-10-26
**Completed:** 2025-10-26

## What is the Technical Debt?

**Current situation:**

Igris AI has 9 shell scripts totaling 784 lines of critical code (initialization, plugin management, updates) with **ZERO automated tests**.

**Script inventory:**
- `igris_init.sh` (289 lines)
- `plugin_install.sh` (214 lines)
- `plugin_update.sh` (238 lines)
- `igris_update.sh` (271 lines)
- `plugin_uninstall.sh` (141 lines)
- `plugin_list.sh` (49 lines)
- `install_shell_integration.sh` (184 lines)
- `persona_mask.sh` (279 lines)
- `persona_install.sh` (139 lines)

**Why is it technical debt?**

- Changes can break existing functionality silently
- No regression protection
- Manual testing is time-consuming and error-prone
- Can't confidently accept community contributions
- No CI/CD validation before merging
- Violates software engineering best practices

**Examples:**
```bash
# Critical paths with NO test coverage:
- igris_init.sh initialization flow
- Plugin install/uninstall/update operations
- CLAUDE.md regeneration logic
- JSON manipulation with Python3
- Hook resolution and injection
- Error handling paths
```

---

## Why It Matters

**Consequences of not fixing:**

- [x] **Maintainability:** Changes are risky - might break existing functionality
- [ ] **Readability:** (Not directly affected)
- [x] **Performance:** Can't benchmark or detect performance regressions
- [x] **Security:** Can't validate security-related changes
- [x] **Scalability:** Can't safely add new features
- [x] **Developer Experience:** Contributors can't verify their changes work

**Impact:** High

Real-world scenarios that need test coverage:
- User installs Igris AI → all files created correctly?
- User installs plugin → registered correctly?
- User updates Igris AI → backup created? Files preserved?
- Plugin provides hooks → CLAUDE.md regenerated correctly?
- Python3 missing → clear error message?

---

## Cleanup Steps

**How to pay off this debt:**

1. [ ] Choose testing framework (bats or shellspec - see comparison below)
2. [ ] Set up test infrastructure (test/, fixtures/, helpers/)
3. [ ] Write tests for critical paths (init, plugin ops, update)
4. [ ] Write tests for error handling (missing dependencies, invalid inputs)
5. [ ] Write tests for edge cases (empty files, special characters)
6. [ ] Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
7. [ ] Add test coverage reporting
8. [ ] Document testing in CONTRIBUTING.md
9. [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md

---

## Benefits of Fixing

**What improves after cleanup:**

- ✅ **Confidence** - Changes can be validated automatically
- ✅ **Regression protection** - Old bugs stay fixed
- ✅ **Faster development** - No manual testing needed
- ✅ **Community contributions** - Contributors can test their changes
- ✅ **CI/CD integration** - Automated quality gates
- ✅ **Documentation** - Tests serve as usage examples
- ✅ **Debugging** - Easier to isolate issues

**Return on Investment:** Very High

Initial investment (3-5 days) pays dividends forever. Every future change becomes safer.

## Affected Areas

### Files to Create

**Test infrastructure:**
- `test/test_helper.bash` - Shared test utilities
- `test/fixtures/` - Test data (sample projects, plugin manifests)
- `test/igris_init.test.bash` - Init script tests
- `test/plugin_install.test.bash` - Plugin install tests
- `test/plugin_update.test.bash` - Plugin update tests
- `test/plugin_uninstall.test.bash` - Plugin uninstall tests
- `test/igris_update.test.bash` - Update script tests
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI/CD workflow

### Files to Modify
- `README.md` - Add testing section
- `ai/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Add testing guidelines
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Document test addition

### Count
**Total test files:** ~8
**Total lines to write:** ~800-1200 (comprehensive test suite)

---

## Testing Framework Comparison

### Option 1: bats (Bash Automated Testing System)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Designed specifically for bash testing
- ✅ Simple, readable syntax
- ✅ Popular (10k+ GitHub stars)
- ✅ Good GitHub Actions integration
- ✅ TAP output format

**Cons:**
- ❌ Less feature-rich than shellspec
- ❌ No built-in mocking

**Example:**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

@test "igris_init creates ai/ directory" {
  cd "$BATS_TMPDIR"
  mkdir test-project && cd test-project

  run ../igris-ai/scripts/igris_init.sh .

  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ -d "ai" ]
  [ -d "ai/briefs" ]
  [ -d "ai/session" ]
}

@test "igris_init creates CLAUDE.md" {
  # ... test
}
```

### Option 2: shellspec

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full-featured BDD framework
- ✅ Mocking and stubbing support
- ✅ Coverage reporting
- ✅ More sophisticated assertions

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Steeper learning curve
- ❌ Less popular than bats

**Example:**
```bash
Describe 'igris_init.sh'
  It 'creates ai/ directory structure'
    When call igris_init.sh /tmp/test-project
    The status should be success
    The directory "/tmp/test-project/ai" should exist
    The directory "/tmp/test-project/ai/briefs" should exist
  End
End
```

**Recommendation:** **bats** - Simpler, more popular, good enough for our needs.

## Test Coverage Goals

### Critical Paths (Must Test)

**igris_init.sh:**
- [ ] Creates all required directories
- [ ] Copies templates correctly
- [ ] Generates CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Creates startup hook
- [ ] Handles existing installation (overwrite prompt)
- [ ] Validates target directory exists

**plugin_install.sh:**
- [ ] Clones plugin repository
- [ ] Validates plugin.json exists
- [ ] Runs plugin install.sh
- [ ] Registers plugin in installed.json
- [ ] Regenerates CLAUDE.md if hooks present
- [ ] Handles plugin already installed

**plugin_update.sh:**
- [ ] Updates plugin to latest version
- [ ] Preserves user data
- [ ] Updates plugin registry
- [ ] Creates backup before update

**igris_update.sh:**
- [ ] Updates core files
- [ ] Preserves user data (briefs, session, context)
- [ ] Creates backup
- [ ] Updates version file

### Error Handling (Must Test)

- [ ] Missing dependencies (python3, git, jq)
- [ ] Invalid plugin repository
- [ ] Corrupted plugin.json
- [ ] Permission denied scenarios
- [ ] Disk space issues

### Edge Cases (Should Test)

- [ ] Empty PERSONA_INJECTION
- [ ] Multi-line PERSONA_INJECTION
- [ ] Special characters in file paths
- [ ] Simultaneous installations (race conditions)

### Target Coverage
- **Critical paths:** 100%
- **Error handling:** 80%
- **Edge cases:** 60%
- **Overall:** 75%+

  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install bats
        run: |
          git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
          cd bats-core
          ./install.sh /usr/local

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          # Python3, jq, etc.

      - name: Run tests
        run: bats test/

      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          files: ./coverage.txt
```

## Testing

### Regression Testing
- [ ] All existing scripts still work
- [ ] No functionality changes
- [ ] Tests don't interfere with normal usage

### Verification
**How to verify cleanup is successful:**

1. Run test suite: `bats test/`
2. All tests pass
3. Coverage report shows 75%+ coverage
4. CI/CD pipeline runs on every PR
5. Tests catch intentional bugs (negative testing)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

## Notes

### Why This Matters - Real Example

**BR-005 (CLAUDE.md regeneration bug) would have been caught by this test:**

```bash
@test "plugin_install regenerates CLAUDE.md with multi-line persona" {
  # Setup
  create_test_project
  install_igris_ai
  create_mock_persona_plugin_with_multiline_content

  # Execute
  run ./scripts/plugin_install.sh /tmp/mock-persona-plugin

  # Assert
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]

  # Verify CLAUDE.md contains multi-line content (not literal \n)
  run grep -c "\\n" CLAUDE.md
  [ "$output" -eq 0 ]  # Should be 0 (no literal \n)

  run grep -c "Igris" CLAUDE.md
  [ "$output" -gt 0 ]  # Should contain persona content
}
```

**This bug shipped to production because we have no tests.**

With tests, this would have been caught immediately.
