## Process Issue

**What's inefficient or broken in the current workflow?**

[Describe the current process problem. Be specific about pain points, wasted time, manual steps, or error-prone procedures.]

**Why does it matter?**

[Impact on productivity, reliability, team velocity, or error rates. Justify priority.]

---

## Current Process

**How does it work now?**

1. [Step 1 of current process]
2. [Step 2 of current process]
3. [Step 3 of current process]

**Pain points:**
- ❌ [Pain point 1: e.g., Manual copy-paste required]
- ❌ [Pain point 2: e.g., Frequent context resets lose work]
- ❌ [Pain point 3: e.g., No validation, easy to forget]

---

## Improved Process

**How should it work after this improvement?**

1. [Step 1 of improved process]
2. [Step 2 of improved process]
3. [Step 3 of improved process]

**Benefits:**
- ✅ [Benefit 1: e.g., Automated validation]
- ✅ [Benefit 2: e.g., No manual steps]
- ✅ [Benefit 3: e.g., Recovery guaranteed]

## Context & Inputs

### Affected Workflows
- [ ] Brief creation workflow
- [ ] Brief implementation workflow
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Context reset recovery
- [ ] Commit process
- [ ] Testing workflow
- [ ] Other: [specify]

### Files to Create
- [List new files needed]

### Files to Modify
- [List existing files to update]

### Dependencies
- [ ] Existing process: [which one]
- [ ] Tool/system: [name]
- [ ] Documentation: [which docs]

---

## Constraints

### Process Rules
- Must maintain existing functionality
- Must not add excessive overhead
- Must be easy to understand and follow
- Should reduce cognitive load, not increase it

### Technical Constraints
- [e.g., Must work without external dependencies]
- [e.g., Must be recoverable after context reset]

### Timeline
- **Deadline:** [Date or N/A]
- **Milestones:** [Optional checkpoints]

### Out of Scope
- [What this improvement explicitly does NOT change]

---

## Tasks

### Pending
- [ ] Task 1: [Description of work to be done]
- [ ] Task 2: [Description of work to be done]
- [ ] Task 3: [Description of work to be done]

### In Progress
_(Tasks currently being worked on)_
- [x] Task X: [Description] (started: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

### Completed
_(Finished tasks)_
- [x] Task Y: [Description] (completed: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

**Note:** Update this section as you work. Mark tasks in_progress when starting, completed when done. Add timestamps.

## Session State (Tactical - This Brief)

**Current State:** [What you're working on RIGHT NOW in this brief]
**Next Steps When Resuming:** [Exact continuation point if interrupted]
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Blockers:** [Any blockers specific to this brief, or "None"]

**Note:** Strategic session state (overall plan/phase across multiple briefs) managed in `ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md`

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**The process improvement is complete when:**

1. [ ] [Testable outcome 1]
2. [ ] [Testable outcome 2]
3. [ ] [Testable outcome 3]
4. [ ] New process documented in relevant files
5. [ ] Old process deprecated/removed
6. [ ] Team members can follow new process
7. [ ] Process improvement tested in real scenario

---

## Verification Plan

### Test New Process
**Scenario:** [Real-world test case]
**Steps:**
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

**Expected Result:** [What should happen with new process]
**Old Result:** [What happened with old process - show improvement]

### Regression Check
- [ ] Existing workflows still work
- [ ] No new pain points introduced
- [ ] Improvement actually saves time/reduces errors

---

## Delivery

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Process documentation: [file to update]
- [ ] Workflow guides: [section to update]
- [ ] Templates: [new or modified]
- [ ] README: [if user-facing change]

### Training/Communication
- [ ] Team notified of new process: [Yes/No]
- [ ] Examples provided: [Yes/No]
- [ ] Migration path documented: [Yes/No]
