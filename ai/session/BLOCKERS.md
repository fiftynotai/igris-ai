### [2025-10-13] - BR-004: Printer Name Text Overflow in Settings List âœ…

**Priority:** P2-Medium
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Brief:** `ai/briefs/BR-004-printer-name-text-overflow.md`

**Issue:**
Printer names wrapped to multiple lines in the settings list when too long, creating visual inconsistency and poor UX. Text got squeezed between the leading icon and trailing disconnect button.

**Resolution:**
Required 4 iterations to fully resolve:
1. Added text truncation (maxLines + overflow to CustomText)
2. Reduced ListTile leading space (horizontalTitleGap + minLeadingWidth)
3. Complete redesign: Replaced ListTile with custom Row layout
4. Final structure optimization: Moved background color to parent Container

**Final Solution:**
- Custom Row-based layout: Container > InkWell > Padding > Row
- Leading icon: 28px (vs ListTile's 56dp+)
- Content: Expanded widget for maximum space
- Trailing button: 36px (vs IconButton's 48dp minimum)
- Result: 56px more horizontal space for printer names

**Changes:**
- Modified: `lib/src/views/custom/custom_text.dart` (added overflow parameter)
- Modified: `lib/src/modules/settings/views/printers_list.dart` (complete list item redesign)
- Commits: `8163ee9`, `86bc0db`, `d7f587f`, `012000b`

**Resolved:** 2025-10-13
**Resolution Time:** ~3 hours (4 iterations)

### [2025-10-13] - BR-002: Printer Status Not Refreshing After Reconnection âœ…

**Priority:** P1-High
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Brief:** `ai/briefs/BR-002-printer-status-not-refreshing.md`

**Issue:**
Bluetooth printer status didn't auto-refresh to "Connected" when printer turned back on. PrintBluetoothThermal.connectionStatus returned cached state from last manual connect/disconnect, not actual live printer status.

**Resolution:**
Added automatic reconnection logic to status checking:
- Created `_checkBluetoothPrinterStatus()` method that attempts silent reconnection
- When status check finds printer offline, it now tries to reconnect automatically
- If reconnection succeeds, status updates to "Connected" within 10 seconds
- Silent operation - no errors thrown, non-blocking
- Timer continues checking every 10 seconds, enabling automatic recovery

**Changes:**
- Modified: `lib/src/modules/settings/controllers/settings_view_model.dart` (added auto-reconnect logic)
- Commit: `99cba70` (fix(settings): auto-reconnect Bluetooth printers when they come back online)

**Resolved:** 2025-10-13
**Resolution Time:** ~1 hour (analysis + fix + test)

### [2025-10-13] - BR-005: Grey Area Appears When Loading WiFi Printers âœ…

**Priority:** P1-High
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Brief:** `ai/briefs/BR-005-wifi-printer-scan-grey-area.md`

**Issue:**
Intermittent grey/blank area appeared in printer list when scanning for WiFi printers. Multiple root causes: no error handling in WiFi scan methods, no loading state indicator, silent failures, and NetworkAnalyzer stream errors not caught.

**Resolution:**
Added comprehensive error handling and loading states:
- Added `isScanning` RxBool to SettingsViewModel for loading state tracking
- Wrapped `searchForDevices()` in try-finally to ensure loading state clears
- Added error handling to `_searchForDevicesByWifi()` to prevent silent failures
- Added input validation for IP/port in `scanPrintersByWifi()` service method
- Added stream error handling and 6-second timeout for NetworkAnalyzer
- Updated UI to show CircularProgressIndicator during scan
- Show "No devices found" only after scan completes (not during loading)

**Changes:**
- Modified: `lib/src/modules/settings/controllers/settings_view_model.dart` (loading state + error handling)
- Modified: `lib/src/modules/settings/data/services/settings_service.dart` (input validation + stream error handling)
- Modified: `lib/src/modules/settings/views/printers_list.dart` (loading UI)
- Commit: `225dd4d` (fix(settings): eliminate grey area during WiFi printer scanning)

**Resolved:** 2025-10-13
**Resolution Time:** ~3 hours (analysis + implementation + testing)

### [2025-10-13] - BR-003: App Crashes on Startup with WiFi Printer Configured âœ…

**Priority:** P0-Critical
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Brief:** `ai/briefs/BR-003-app-crash-wifi-printer-auto-connect.md`

**Issue:**
App crashed on startup when a WiFi (IP) printer was configured. The auto-reconnect logic in `_reconnectToLastKnownPrinters()` and status checking timer attempted to ping WiFi printers during initialization without proper error handling.

**Resolution:**
Added comprehensive error handling:
- Wrapped `_initialize()` method in try-catch to prevent initialization crashes
- Added error handling to `_startStatusCheckTimer()` for both initial and periodic status checks
- App now gracefully handles network errors during startup
- WiFi printer status checking failures are logged but don't crash the app

**Changes:**
- Modified: `lib/src/modules/settings/controllers/settings_view_model.dart`
- Commit: `c57a7c6` (fix(settings): prevent app crash on startup with WiFi printer configured)

**Resolved:** 2025-10-13
**Resolution Time:** ~2 hours (analysis + fix + test)
