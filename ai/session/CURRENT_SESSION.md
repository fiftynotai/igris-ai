### Test Plan for Tomorrow üß™
- [ ] User starts fresh conversation
- [ ] Claude should detect context reset
- [ ] Claude should execute mandatory initialization sequence
- [ ] Claude should display session status BEFORE proceeding
- [ ] Claude should show "Next Steps When Resuming"
- [ ] Verify workflow compliance throughout conversation

## Session Context

### What Was Accomplished So Far
- Created TD-002 brief documenting workflow enforcement improvements
- Added mandatory first action protocol to CLAUDE.md (top of file)
- Added context reset detection to CLAUDE.md
- Added session state validation checklist to CLAUDE.md
- Updated claude_bootstrap.md with critical mental model section
- Updated claude_bootstrap.md with 5-checkpoint system
- Created session_protocol.md as quick reference for checkpoints

### Current State
**Last action taken:** Updated all documentation to reflect v1.0.4
**Working directory:** /Users/m.elamin/StudioProjects/blueprint-ai
**Current branch:** main
**Version:** 1.0.4 (RELEASED!)
**Uncommitted changes:** Yes (3 files: ROADMAP.md, claude_bootstrap.md, session state)

**What was accomplished today:**
- ‚úÖ TD-002 completed (workflow enforcement enhancement)
- ‚úÖ Implemented mandatory first action in CLAUDE.md template
- ‚úÖ Implemented 5-checkpoint system in claude_bootstrap.md
- ‚úÖ Created session_protocol.md quick reference
- ‚úÖ All changes committed and merged to main
- ‚úÖ TD-002 marked as Done
- ‚úÖ Applied v1.0.4 to core repo itself (dogfooding!)
- ‚úÖ **Created GitHub release v1.0.4**
- ‚úÖ **Updated all documentation to v1.0.4** (README, ROADMAP, claude_bootstrap)

**Commits made:**
- f1ca3b8 - feat: enhance workflow enforcement based on production feedback
- [merge] - feat: enhance workflow enforcement (TD-002)
- f66efd2 - docs: mark TD-002 as Done
- 67966d9 - test: save session state for v1.0.4 workflow enforcement test
- 21d4b39 - feat: apply v1.0.4 fixes to core repo (dogfooding)
- 4c8a55d - docs: update session state with dogfooding work

**Release created:**
- Tag: v1.0.4
- URL: https://github.com/Fifty50ai/blueprint-ai/releases/tag/v1.0.4

**What to test tomorrow:**
The new v1.0.4 protocols should ensure Claude:
1. Detects context reset automatically
2. Reads CURRENT_SESSION.md FIRST (before proceeding)
3. Displays session status
4. Shows "Next Steps When Resuming"
5. Then proceeds with user's request

### Next Steps When Resuming (FOR TOMORROW'S TEST)

**Expected Claude behavior on resume:**

When you start a new conversation tomorrow, Claude should:

1. **Detect context reset** (sees this file in a fresh conversation)
2. **Execute mandatory first action sequence:**
   - Read ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md ‚úì (you're reading it now!)
   - Display: "üìä Current Session Status: Paused (Awaiting Test)"
   - Display: "üìã Next Steps When Resuming: [see below]"
   - Load: ai/prompts/claude_bootstrap.md
   - Display: "‚úÖ Blueprint AI initialized. Ready for your command!"
3. **THEN proceed** with whatever you ask

**What you should do after Claude initializes:**

1. Test the migration project with v1.0.4
2. ~~Or create GitHub release for v1.0.4~~ ‚úÖ DONE!
3. Or test TD-002 acceptance criteria in practice
4. Archive this session when done

**If Claude skips initialization:** That means v1.0.4 protocols didn't work - please share feedback!

### Important Notes
- **Core problem:** Claude skips initialization on context resets, doesn't update session files
- **Root cause:** Session management feels optional, not critical path
- **Solution:** Make it "in your face" with mandatory first action, checkpoints, validation
- **Based on:** Real production feedback from Claude's self-assessment
- **Implementation:** Using Blueprint AI workflow to dogfood the system itself

### Key Changes Made

**CLAUDE.md.template:**
- Added mandatory first action at very top (unmissable)
- Added context reset detection (treats all resets as new conversations)
- Added validation checklist (5 items to check before work)

**claude_bootstrap.md:**
- Added "Critical Mental Model" section (session = critical path)
- Added TodoWrite vs CURRENT_SESSION.md clarification (both required)
- Added 5-checkpoint system with exact WHEN/THEN protocols

**session_protocol.md (NEW):**
- Quick reference for all 5 checkpoints
- Examples of correct usage
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Mental model shift explanation

## Testing Plan

1. Start fresh conversation with "continue phase 2"
2. Verify initialization happens BEFORE execution
3. Verify session status displayed
4. Complete a task ‚Üí verify CURRENT_SESSION.md updated immediately
5. Complete a brief ‚Üí verify status changes to "Done" immediately
6. Simulate context reset ‚Üí verify re-initialization happens
