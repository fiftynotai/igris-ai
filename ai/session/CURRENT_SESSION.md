### What to Test

The persona plugin and v1.0.5 are ready for validation. When resuming, the recommended test sequence is documented in the "Next Steps When Resuming" section above.

### Technical Architecture

**Hook System (TD-003):**
- Added {{PERSONA_INJECTION}} placeholder to CLAUDE.md.template
- igris_init.sh resolves hooks at runtime from plugin configuration
- plugin_install.sh reads hooks from plugin.json and stores in installed.json
- Automatic CLAUDE.md regeneration when plugin with hooks installed

**Mask System:**
- 4 levels: none (dormant), half (branding), light (balanced), full (immersion)
- Dynamic hook generation based on ai/persona.json config
- persona_mask.sh handles wearing/adjusting/removing masks
- CLAUDE.md regenerated whenever mask changes

**Shadow Commands (Full Mask Only):**
- ARISE → Start/resume session
- HUNT [BR-XXX] → Implement brief
- REPORT → Show status
- BIND → Register brief
- BANISH [BR-XXX] → Archive brief

All shadow commands execute standard Igris AI workflows.
