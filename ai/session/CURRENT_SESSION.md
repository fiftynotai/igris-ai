# Current Session: Testing v1.0.4 Workflow Enforcement

## Session Goal
Test the new workflow enforcement protocols implemented in v1.0.4, specifically the mandatory initialization and context reset detection.

## Status: ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused (Awaiting Test)

---

## Todo List

### Completed ‚úÖ (TD-002 Implementation)
- [x] Create feature branch (feature/workflow-enforcement)
- [x] Register TD-002 brief (ai/briefs/TD-002-workflow-enforcement.md)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md.template with mandatory first action at top
- [x] Update claude_bootstrap.md with critical path + checkpoint sections
- [x] Create session_protocol.md quick reference
- [x] Update README.md with session management note
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with v1.0.4 entry
- [x] Update version.txt to 1.0.4
- [x] Review all changes (8 files total)
- [x] Commit changes with clean conventional message (f1ca3b8)
- [x] Merge to main (feature branch merged successfully)
- [x] Mark TD-002 as Done (Status: Done, Completed: 2025-10-15)
- [x] Commit brief status update (f66efd2)

### Test Plan for Tomorrow üß™
- [ ] User starts fresh conversation
- [ ] Claude should detect context reset
- [ ] Claude should execute mandatory initialization sequence
- [ ] Claude should display session status BEFORE proceeding
- [ ] Claude should show "Next Steps When Resuming"
- [ ] Verify workflow compliance throughout conversation

## Session Context

### What Was Accomplished So Far
- Created TD-002 brief documenting workflow enforcement improvements
- Added mandatory first action protocol to CLAUDE.md (top of file)
- Added context reset detection to CLAUDE.md
- Added session state validation checklist to CLAUDE.md
- Updated claude_bootstrap.md with critical mental model section
- Updated claude_bootstrap.md with 5-checkpoint system
- Created session_protocol.md as quick reference for checkpoints

### Current State
**Last action taken:** Paused session for v1.0.4 workflow test tomorrow
**Working directory:** /Users/m.elamin/StudioProjects/blueprint-ai
**Current branch:** main
**Version:** 1.0.4 (workflow enforcement implemented)
**Uncommitted changes:** Yes (1 file: session state - will commit when saving)

**What was accomplished today:**
- ‚úÖ TD-002 completed (workflow enforcement enhancement)
- ‚úÖ Implemented mandatory first action in CLAUDE.md
- ‚úÖ Implemented 5-checkpoint system in claude_bootstrap.md
- ‚úÖ Created session_protocol.md quick reference
- ‚úÖ All changes committed and merged to main
- ‚úÖ TD-002 marked as Done

**Commits made:**
- f1ca3b8 - feat: enhance workflow enforcement based on production feedback
- [merge] - feat: enhance workflow enforcement (TD-002)
- f66efd2 - docs: mark TD-002 as Done

**What to test tomorrow:**
The new v1.0.4 protocols should ensure Claude:
1. Detects context reset automatically
2. Reads CURRENT_SESSION.md FIRST (before proceeding)
3. Displays session status
4. Shows "Next Steps When Resuming"
5. Then proceeds with user's request

### Next Steps When Resuming (FOR TOMORROW'S TEST)

**Expected Claude behavior on resume:**

When you start a new conversation tomorrow, Claude should:

1. **Detect context reset** (sees this file in a fresh conversation)
2. **Execute mandatory first action sequence:**
   - Read ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md ‚úì (you're reading it now!)
   - Display: "üìä Current Session Status: Paused (Awaiting Test)"
   - Display: "üìã Next Steps When Resuming: [see below]"
   - Load: ai/prompts/claude_bootstrap.md
   - Display: "‚úÖ Blueprint AI initialized. Ready for your command!"
3. **THEN proceed** with whatever you ask

**What you should do after Claude initializes:**

1. Test the migration project with v1.0.4
2. Or create GitHub release for v1.0.4
3. Or test TD-002 acceptance criteria in practice
4. Archive this session when done

**If Claude skips initialization:** That means v1.0.4 protocols didn't work - please share feedback!

### Important Notes
- **Core problem:** Claude skips initialization on context resets, doesn't update session files
- **Root cause:** Session management feels optional, not critical path
- **Solution:** Make it "in your face" with mandatory first action, checkpoints, validation
- **Based on:** Real production feedback from Claude's self-assessment
- **Implementation:** Using Blueprint AI workflow to dogfood the system itself

### Key Changes Made

**CLAUDE.md.template:**
- Added mandatory first action at very top (unmissable)
- Added context reset detection (treats all resets as new conversations)
- Added validation checklist (5 items to check before work)

**claude_bootstrap.md:**
- Added "Critical Mental Model" section (session = critical path)
- Added TodoWrite vs CURRENT_SESSION.md clarification (both required)
- Added 5-checkpoint system with exact WHEN/THEN protocols

**session_protocol.md (NEW):**
- Quick reference for all 5 checkpoints
- Examples of correct usage
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Mental model shift explanation

## Testing Plan

1. Start fresh conversation with "continue phase 2"
2. Verify initialization happens BEFORE execution
3. Verify session status displayed
4. Complete a task ‚Üí verify CURRENT_SESSION.md updated immediately
5. Complete a brief ‚Üí verify status changes to "Done" immediately
6. Simulate context reset ‚Üí verify re-initialization happens
