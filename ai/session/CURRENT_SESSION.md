### Next Steps When Resuming üéØ

**Context:** We've completed TD-003 (hook system) and built the entire persona packs plugin. Plugin is packaged and ready for testing.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Test Persona Plugin Locally**
   ```bash
   # Install plugin from local package
   ./scripts/plugin_install.sh file:///tmp/blueprint-ai-persona-packs

   # Run interactive installer
   ./scripts/persona_install.sh

   # Test mask switching
   ./scripts/persona_mask.sh status
   ./scripts/persona_mask.sh wear igris full
   ```

2. **Fix Any Bugs Found**
   - Verify hook injection works
   - Test all 4 mask levels
   - Verify CLAUDE.md regeneration
   - Test shadow commands (if full mask)

3. **Release v1.0.5 (Blueprint AI Core)**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.5 -m "Release v1.0.5 - Plugin Hook System"
   git push origin v1.0.5
   gh release create v1.0.5 --title "v1.0.5 - Plugin Hook System"
   ```

4. **Create Persona Plugin Repository**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp && tar -xzf blueprint-ai-persona-packs.tar.gz
   cd blueprint-ai-persona-packs
   # Initialize git, push to new repo
   ```

5. **Release v1.0.0 (Persona Plugin)**
   - Tag v1.0.0
   - Create GitHub release
   - Update Blueprint AI README with link

**Key Files:**
- Plugin package: `/tmp/blueprint-ai-persona-packs.tar.gz`

### What to Test

The persona plugin and v1.0.5 are ready for validation. When resuming, the recommended test sequence is documented in the "Next Steps When Resuming" section above.

### Technical Architecture

**Hook System (TD-003):**
- Added {{PERSONA_INJECTION}} placeholder to CLAUDE.md.template
- blueprint_init.sh resolves hooks at runtime from plugin configuration
- plugin_install.sh reads hooks from plugin.json and stores in installed.json
- Automatic CLAUDE.md regeneration when plugin with hooks installed

**Mask System:**
- 4 levels: none (dormant), half (branding), light (balanced), full (immersion)
- Dynamic hook generation based on ai/persona.json config
- persona_mask.sh handles wearing/adjusting/removing masks
- CLAUDE.md regenerated whenever mask changes

**Shadow Commands (Full Mask Only):**
- ARISE ‚Üí Start/resume session
- HUNT [BR-XXX] ‚Üí Implement brief
- REPORT ‚Üí Show status
- BIND ‚Üí Register brief
- BANISH [BR-XXX] ‚Üí Archive brief

All shadow commands execute standard Blueprint AI workflows.
