## Session Context

### What Was Accomplished So Far
- Created TD-002 brief documenting workflow enforcement improvements
- Added mandatory first action protocol to CLAUDE.md (top of file)
- Added context reset detection to CLAUDE.md
- Added session state validation checklist to CLAUDE.md
- Updated claude_bootstrap.md with critical mental model section
- Updated claude_bootstrap.md with 5-checkpoint system
- Created session_protocol.md as quick reference for checkpoints

### Current State
**Last action taken:** TD-002 completed and merged to main ✅
**Working directory:** /Users/m.elamin/StudioProjects/blueprint-ai
**Current branch:** main
**Uncommitted changes:** Yes (2 files: brief status + session state)

**Commits made:**
- f1ca3b8 - feat: enhance workflow enforcement based on production feedback
- [merge commit] - feat: enhance workflow enforcement (TD-002)

**Files modified in this session:**
- scripts/templates/CLAUDE.md.template (added mandatory first action)
- ai/prompts/claude_bootstrap.md (added critical path + checkpoints)
- README.md (added session management section)
- CHANGELOG.md (added v1.0.4 entry)
- version.txt (updated to 1.0.4)
- ai/session/CURRENT_SESSION.md (tracked this session)
- ai/briefs/TD-002-workflow-enforcement.md (created + marked Done)

**Files created in this session:**
- ai/briefs/TD-002-workflow-enforcement.md
- ai/prompts/session_protocol.md

### Next Steps When Resuming
1. Commit brief status update and session state
2. Consider testing v1.0.4 in a fresh project
3. Consider creating GitHub release for v1.0.4
4. Archive this session to ai/session/archive/2025-10-15-001.md

### Important Notes
- **Core problem:** Claude skips initialization on context resets, doesn't update session files
- **Root cause:** Session management feels optional, not critical path
- **Solution:** Make it "in your face" with mandatory first action, checkpoints, validation
- **Based on:** Real production feedback from Claude's self-assessment
- **Implementation:** Using Blueprint AI workflow to dogfood the system itself

### Key Changes Made

**CLAUDE.md.template:**
- Added mandatory first action at very top (unmissable)
- Added context reset detection (treats all resets as new conversations)
- Added validation checklist (5 items to check before work)

**claude_bootstrap.md:**
- Added "Critical Mental Model" section (session = critical path)
- Added TodoWrite vs CURRENT_SESSION.md clarification (both required)
- Added 5-checkpoint system with exact WHEN/THEN protocols

**session_protocol.md (NEW):**
- Quick reference for all 5 checkpoints
- Examples of correct usage
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Mental model shift explanation

---

## Testing Plan

1. Start fresh conversation with "continue phase 2"
2. Verify initialization happens BEFORE execution
3. Verify session status displayed
4. Complete a task → verify CURRENT_SESSION.md updated immediately
5. Complete a brief → verify status changes to "Done" immediately
6. Simulate context reset → verify re-initialization happens
