## Session Context

### What Was Accomplished
- Created comprehensive bug & feature management system for Blueprint AI
- Added 2 complete prompt files with 9 operations each
- Created CONTRIBUTING.md guide with quick reference
- Updated claude_bootstrap.md with detailed AI instructions
- Created archive folder structure for completed work
- Updated README.md with bug/feature management section

### Current State
**Last action taken:** Updating CURRENT_SESSION.md
**Working directory:** /Users/m.elamin/StudioProjects/opaala_admin_app_v3
**Current branch:** feature/blueprint-ai-pilot
**Uncommitted changes:** No (all committed in e484763)

### Next Steps When Resuming
1. Test the new prompts by registering a bug or feature
2. Consider creating example briefs (BR-002, BR-003) for reference
3. May want to push branch to remote

### Important Notes
- System supports complete lifecycle: register → list → prioritize → implement → archive
- Separates registration (brief creation) from implementation (actual work)
- 9 operations per type: register, list, remove, implement, prioritize, update status, show next, status report, archive
- Startup and mid-conversation prompts for both bugs and features
- Archive structure created: ai/session/archive/briefs/ and ai/session/archive/sessions/
- P0/P1 bugs automatically added to BLOCKERS.md
