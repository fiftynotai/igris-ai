# Feature Management Prompts

Complete guide for managing feature requests throughout their lifecycle: register ‚Üí list ‚Üí prioritize ‚Üí implement ‚Üí archive.

---

## 1. Register Feature

Use these prompts to **create a feature brief** (registration only - no implementation).

### Startup Prompt (New Conversation)

Copy-paste this when starting a fresh conversation:

```
I need to register a feature request (DO NOT implement yet, just create the brief).

**Feature name:** [descriptive name, e.g., "Export Orders to CSV"]

**Problem:**
[What problem does this solve? Why is it needed?]

Example: "Restaurant managers need to export order data for accounting
purposes but currently have to manually copy data from the app."

**Proposed solution:**
[How should it work? What should users see/do?]

Example: "Add 'Export' button in History screen that generates CSV file
with order details (ID, items, total, date, payment method) and shares
it via Android/iOS share dialog."

**Affected modules:**
[Check all that apply]
- [ ] auth
- [ ] event
- [ ] venue
- [ ] details
- [ ] kds
- [x] settings
- [x] history
- [ ] home
- [ ] connections
- [ ] Other: [specify]

**User impact:**
[Who benefits? How does it help?]

Example: "Restaurant managers save 2-3 hours per week. Accountants get
accurate data in compatible format."

**Priority:** [P0-Critical | P1-High | P2-Medium | P3-Low]
**Effort estimate:** [S-Small | M-Medium | L-Large | XL-Extra Large]

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. [User can do X, e.g., "User can tap Export button in History screen"]
2. [System shows Y, e.g., "CSV file includes all order fields"]
3. [Feature works in Z scenario, e.g., "Export works for date ranges"]

Please create a brief for this feature as BR-XXX.
```

### Mid-Conversation Prompt

Already talking to AI? Use this shorter format:

```
Register a feature (don't implement):

Feature: [name]
Problem: [what it solves]
Solution: [how it should work]
Modules: [affected areas]
Priority: [P0/P1/P2/P3]

Acceptance criteria:
1. [criterion 1]
2. [criterion 2]

Create brief BR-XXX for this.
```

### Quick Registration (Minimal)

For fast feature logging:

```
Feature registration only:
- What: [feature name]
- Why: [problem it solves]
- Where: [modules affected]
- Priority: [P0/P1/P2/P3]

Create brief, don't implement.
```

### What AI Will Do

After using these prompts, AI will:
1. ‚úÖ Create `ai/briefs/BR-XXX-feature-name.md` from template
2. ‚úÖ Assign next available BR number (e.g., BR-008)
3. ‚úÖ Set Status: "Ready" (or "Draft" if info incomplete)
4. ‚úÖ Add to feature backlog
5. ‚ùå Will **NOT** start implementation
6. ‚ùå Will **NOT** load context files

To implement later, say: **"Implement BR-XXX"**

## Tips

### When to Use Each Priority

- **P0 - Critical:** Blocking major release, contractual obligation, critical business need
- **P1 - High:** High user demand, significant business value, competitive advantage
- **P2 - Medium:** Nice-to-have, improves UX, requested by some users
- **P3 - Low:** Polish, experimental, low user demand

### When to Use Each Effort Estimate

- **S - Small (< 4 hours):** Single component, no API changes, minimal testing
- **M - Medium (1-2 days):** Multiple components, minor API changes, standard testing
- **L - Large (3-5 days):** Multiple modules, significant API changes, extensive testing
- **XL - Extra Large (> 1 week):** Major architectural changes, new infrastructure, complex testing

### Writing Good Acceptance Criteria

Make criteria:
- **Testable:** "User can export orders" ‚úÖ (not "Export works well" ‚ùå)
- **Specific:** "CSV includes ID, date, items, total" ‚úÖ (not "CSV has data" ‚ùå)
- **User-focused:** "User sees success message" ‚úÖ (not "Function returns true" ‚ùå)

Example:
```
Good:
1. User taps Export button in History screen
2. System generates CSV with columns: Order ID, Date, Items, Total, Payment
3. User can share CSV via Android/iOS share dialog
4. Export includes orders from selected date range

Poor:
1. Export feature works
2. CSV file is created
3. Data is correct
```

### When to Update Status Manually

Status usually updates automatically during implementation:
- "Ready" ‚Üí "In Progress" (when you say "Implement BR-XXX")
- "In Progress" ‚Üí "Done" (when tests pass and commit is made)

Manual updates are useful for:
- Marking brief as "Draft" when more info needed
- Setting to "In Review" for human code review
- Marking as "Done" after QA verification

## Feature vs Bug: Which to Use?

### Use Feature Brief When:
- Adding new functionality that didn't exist before
- Enhancing existing feature with new capabilities
- Improving UX with new interactions
- Adding integration with new service

### Use Bug Brief When:
- Something that worked before is now broken
- Feature exists but behaves incorrectly
- App crashes or throws errors
- Data is displayed incorrectly

### Examples:

| Scenario | Type | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| Add CSV export to History | Feature | New functionality |
| Export button doesn't work | Bug | Existing feature broken |
| Add dark mode | Feature | New UI theme |
| Colors don't change in dark mode | Bug | Feature not working correctly |
| Add offline support | Feature | New capability |
| App crashes when offline | Bug | Error condition |
