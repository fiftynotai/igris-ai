# Bug Management Prompts

Complete guide for managing bugs throughout their lifecycle: register ‚Üí list ‚Üí prioritize ‚Üí implement ‚Üí archive.

---

## 1. Register Bug

Use these prompts to **create a bug brief** (registration only - no implementation).

### Startup Prompt (New Conversation)

Copy-paste this when starting a fresh conversation:

```
I need to register a bug (DO NOT implement yet, just create the brief).

**Bug in:** [module/feature name, e.g., "Settings - Printer Status"]

**What I was doing:**
1. [step 1, e.g., "Opened printer settings"]
2. [step 2, e.g., "Connected to Bluetooth printer"]
3. [step 3, e.g., "App crashed when checking status"]

**Expected behavior:**
[what should happen, e.g., "Status should show 'Connected' with green dot"]

**Actual behavior:**
[what actually happened, e.g., "App crashes with null pointer exception"]

**Error messages/logs:**
[paste errors if any]
```
Error: NullPointerException at SettingsViewModel.checkPrinterStatus:485
```

**Screenshots:**
[mention if available, e.g., "See screenshot-001.png attached"]

**Priority:** [P0-Critical | P1-High | P2-Medium | P3-Low]
**Effort estimate:** [S-Small | M-Medium | L-Large | XL-Extra Large]

Please create a brief for this bug as BR-XXX.
```

### Mid-Conversation Prompt

Already talking to AI? Use this shorter format:

```
Register a bug (don't implement):

Module: [name]
Issue: [brief description]
Steps to reproduce:
1. [step 1]
2. [step 2]
Expected: [what should happen]
Actual: [what happened]
Priority: [P0/P1/P2/P3]

Create brief BR-XXX for this.
```

### Quick Registration (Minimal)

For fast bug logging:

```
Bug registration only:
- What: [brief description]
- Where: [module]
- Reproduce: [1, 2, 3]
- Priority: [P0/P1/P2/P3]

Create brief, don't implement.
```

### What AI Will Do

After using these prompts, AI will:
1. ‚úÖ Create `ai/briefs/BR-XXX-bug-name.md` from template
2. ‚úÖ Assign next available BR number (e.g., BR-005)
3. ‚úÖ Set Status: "Ready" (or "Draft" if info incomplete)
4. ‚úÖ Add to `ai/session/BLOCKERS.md` if P0 or P1
5. ‚ùå Will **NOT** start implementation
6. ‚ùå Will **NOT** load context files

To implement later, say: **"Implement BR-XXX"** or **"Fix BR-XXX"**

## Tips

### When to Use Each Priority

- **P0 - Critical:** App crashes, data loss, security issues, production blockers
- **P1 - High:** Major features broken, significant UX issues, impacts many users
- **P2 - Medium:** Minor features broken, workaround exists, impacts some users
- **P3 - Low:** Cosmetic issues, edge cases, nice-to-have fixes

### When to Update Status Manually

Status usually updates automatically during implementation:
- "Ready" ‚Üí "In Progress" (when you say "Fix BR-XXX")
- "In Progress" ‚Üí "Done" (when tests pass and commit is made)

Manual updates are useful for:
- Marking brief as "Draft" when more info needed
- Setting to "In Review" for human code review
- Marking as "Done" after manual testing
