# Generate Coding Guidelines Prompt

This prompt analyzes your codebase and/or base architecture repository to create comprehensive coding guidelines for Blueprint AI.

---

## Purpose

Generate `ai/context/coding_guidelines.md` that defines your team's standards for:
- Architecture patterns and layer boundaries
- Naming conventions (files, classes, variables)
- Code structure and organization
- Documentation requirements
- Testing standards
- Best practices and common pitfalls

These guidelines serve as the foundation for:
- Migration analysis (comparing existing code to standards)
- Code reviews
- New development
- Team onboarding

---

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Extract from Base Architecture Repo
**When:** You have a reference implementation (base architecture repo) that defines your standards
**Result:** Extract patterns and conventions from the base repo

### Scenario 2: Infer from Existing Project
**When:** You have existing code but no documented standards
**Result:** Analyze patterns in your code and formalize them as guidelines

### Scenario 3: Merge Base Repo + Project
**When:** You have both a base repo AND existing project code
**Result:** Merge intelligently (base repo = primary, project = supplementary)

---

## Instructions for Claude

When user asks to generate coding guidelines, follow this process:

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Ask the user these questions:

**Question 1:** "Do you have a base architecture repository that defines your standard patterns?"
- **If YES:** Ask for repository URL
- **If NO:** Proceed to Question 2
- **If UNSURE:** Explain what a base repo is, then ask again

**Question 2:** "Should I analyze your current project code to understand existing patterns?"
- **If YES:** Confirm directory to analyze (default: current directory)
- **If NO:** Skip to Step 3

**Question 3:** "What platform/framework is this for?"
- Flutter
- React Native
- React (Web)
- Vue.js
- Angular
- Node.js Backend
- Other (specify)

**Result:** Determine mode (A/B/C) based on answers:
- Mode A: Base repo only (Q1=Yes, Q2=No)
- Mode B: Project analysis only (Q1=No, Q2=Yes)
- Mode C: Merge both (Q1=Yes, Q2=Yes)
- Mode D: Best practices fallback (Q1=No, Q2=No)

---

### Step 2: Analysis

Execute the appropriate mode:

#### Mode A: Extract from Base Repository

**Process:**
1. Clone base repository to temporary directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <base-repo-url> /tmp/base-arch-XXXXX
   ```

2. Scan base repo structure:
   - Use Glob to find all source files
   - Identify example modules (lib/features/, src/modules/, etc.)
   - Look for documentation files

3. Read key documentation files:
   - README.md (architecture overview)
   - CONTRIBUTING.md (contribution guidelines)
   - docs/ directory (any architecture docs)
   - CODE_STYLE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md if present

4. Analyze example modules (read 2-3 complete examples):
   - Identify layer structure (view/viewmodel/service/model)
   - Extract file naming patterns
   - Extract class naming patterns
   - Identify state management approach
   - Find DI patterns
   - Document testing patterns

5. Extract patterns:
   - **Architecture:** What pattern is used? (MVVM, MVC, Clean, etc.)
   - **Layers:** What layers exist and how do they interact?
   - **Naming:** File names (snake_case? camelCase?), Class names (PascalCase?), Variables (camelCase?)
   - **Documentation:** What format for doc comments?
   - **Testing:** What test structure? Coverage requirements?
   - **State Management:** Which library? (GetX, Provider, Redux, etc.)

6. Find code examples:
   - Copy 1-2 examples of "golden" code for each layer
   - These will be used as reference in guidelines

#### Mode B: Infer from Project Code

**Process:**
1. Scan project directory:
   - Use Glob to find all source files
   - Identify file types and counts
   - Map directory structure

2. Analyze multiple modules (sample 3-5):
   - Look for consistent patterns (what's done similarly?)
   - Identify good patterns (well-structured code)
   - Identify inconsistencies (what varies?)
   - Identify potential anti-patterns

3. Infer patterns:
   - **Architecture:** What pattern appears to be used? Look for folders like views/, viewmodels/, controllers/, services/
   - **Naming:** What naming is used most consistently?
   - **Documentation:** Are doc comments present? What format?
   - **Testing:** Are tests present? What coverage?

4. Parse linter configuration:
   - Read analysis_options.yaml (Dart/Flutter)
   - Read .eslintrc.json (JavaScript/TypeScript)
   - Read tsconfig.json (TypeScript)
   - Extract rules and preferences

5. Identify strengths:
   - What is this codebase doing well?
   - What should be preserved?

6. Identify weaknesses:
   - What inconsistencies exist?
   - What needs standardization?
   - What best practices are missing?

7. Supplement with platform best practices:
   - Based on platform (Flutter/React/etc.), add missing best practices
   - Recommend industry standards not currently followed

#### Mode C: Merge Base Repo + Project

**Process:**
1. Execute Mode A (analyze base repo)
2. Execute Mode B (analyze project)
3. Compare findings:
   - Where do they align?
   - Where do they conflict?
4. Merge with priority:
   - **Primary:** Base repo patterns (this is the target standard)
   - **Secondary:** Project patterns (if not conflicting)
   - **Supplementary:** Linter rules from project
5. Document conflicts:
   - List where project deviates from base repo
   - These become migration recommendations
6. Create merged guidelines with:
   - Base repo patterns as "standard"
   - Project patterns as "current state (needs alignment)"
   - Clear migration path from current to standard

#### Mode D: Best Practices Fallback

**Process:**
1. Confirm platform with user
2. Use industry best practices for that platform:
   - Flutter: Clean Architecture, MVVM, GetX/Provider/Riverpod patterns
   - React: Component structure, Hooks, Context, Redux patterns
   - etc.
3. Recommend creating a base architecture repo
4. Offer to generate basic guidelines as starting point

### Step 3: Generate coding_guidelines.md

Create `ai/context/coding_guidelines.md` using this template:

```markdown
# Coding Guidelines — [Project Name]

**Generated:** [Date]
**Source:** [Base Repo URL / Project Analysis / Merged / Best Practices]
**Platform:** [Flutter/React/etc.]

---

## Overview

[Brief description of the standards defined in this document]

[If Mode A or C:]
**Base Architecture:** [Base repo URL]
**Reference Implementation:** [Link to example modules in base repo]

[If Mode B:]
**Note:** These guidelines were inferred from existing project code. Consider creating a base architecture repository for future reference.

[If Mode C:]
**Merge Status:** Base repository patterns are the target standard. Current project deviations are documented below.

---

## Architecture Pattern

**Pattern:** [MVVM / MVC / Clean Architecture / Layered / Other]

**Description:**
[Explain the architecture pattern and its principles]

[If Mode A or C, include:]
**Based on:** [Base repo reference]

**Layer Boundaries:**
```
View (UI)
   ↓ (calls)
Actions (UI Logic) [If applicable]
   ↓ (calls)
ViewModel/Controller (Business Logic)
   ↓ (calls)
Service/Repository (Data Layer)
   ↓ (uses)
Model (Data Structures)
```

**Golden Rule:** [Key principle, e.g., "Views never call Services directly"]

**Layer Responsibilities:**
- **View:** UI rendering, user input handling
- **Actions:** Navigation, dialogs, snackbars (UI side effects) [If applicable]
- **ViewModel/Controller:** Business logic, state management
- **Service/Repository:** API calls, data persistence, external integrations

- All API errors
- Unexpected exceptions
- Critical user actions

**What NOT to log:**
- User credentials or sensitive data
- API keys or secrets
- Personal information (PII)

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

- Follow the layer boundaries defined above
- Write doc comments for all public APIs
- Write tests for all business logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Make models immutable (final fields)
- Handle all error cases
- Use const constructors when possible (Flutter)
- Close streams/sockets/subscriptions when done

[If Mode A or C, add base repo specific practices]

### DON'T ❌

- Skip layers (e.g., View calling Service directly)
- Put UI logic in ViewModel (navigation, dialogs)
- Put business logic in View
- Hardcode strings (use i18n/localization)
- Hardcode API keys or credentials
- Leave empty catch blocks
- Create god classes (classes doing too much)
- Use mutable state without state management
- Forget to dispose controllers/streams

[If Mode A or C, add base repo specific anti-patterns]

---
