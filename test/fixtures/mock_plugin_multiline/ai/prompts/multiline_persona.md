# Multi-Line Persona

Line 1: First line of persona content
Line 2: Second line of persona content
Line 3: Third line of persona content

**This tests newline handling in CLAUDE.md regeneration.**

Expected behavior:
- Each line should appear on separate line in CLAUDE.md
- No literal \n characters should appear
- Formatting should be preserved
